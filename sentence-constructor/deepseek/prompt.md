## Examples
Here are examples of input and output:
<example>
  <user:input>

  </user:input>
  <score> 5 </score>
  <score_reasons>
  - BAD: In the vocabulary table we should not provide the tenses; the student has to figure that out.
  - BAD: In the possible structure we should not provide the particles or tenses; the student has to figure that out.
  - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we want something conceptual like this: [Location][Subject][Verb], [object] [Verb]?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
